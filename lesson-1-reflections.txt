Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug
that was introduced?

R: You can see where the text has been changed and thus focus only on those
parts.

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

R: Having access to all the history gives you the ability to undo any changes
made.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like
Google Docs does?

R: If there is a power fail, or computer hang, you may lose all the changes you
have been working on.

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

R: Some version control systems, like Google Docs, are file oriented, e.g. they
work on one file at a time.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of
files?

R: You would use the git log command to see the various commits and get their
commit ids. You can then use the git diff command to see the difference.

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

R: It would make you more confident as it allows you to always go back to a
working older version.

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git
for?

R: Version control of programming and other tasks.
