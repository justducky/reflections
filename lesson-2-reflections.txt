Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

R: It build the .git directory and creates the initial copies of files git
needs.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

R: The staging area only contains files you want to commit to the repository.
It offers one a way to customize the set of files to commit rather than just
commit all the files in the working directory.
